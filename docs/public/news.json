      "content": "MeshMonitor v3.4.8 brings two major features: a comprehensive **Auto-Acknowledge** settings panel and **Two-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for account security.\n\n## Auto-Acknowledge Settings\n\nThe new Auto-Acknowledge feature automatically responds to incoming messages that match a configurable pattern, making it ideal for network testing and mesh diagnostics.\n\n### Key Capabilities\n\n- **Regex Pattern Matching** - Define which messages trigger auto-responses (default: `^(test|ping)`)\n- **Per-Channel Control** - Enable/disable on individual channels and direct messages\n- **Separate Direct & Multi-Hop Templates** - Customize responses based on connection type\n- **Dynamic Tokens** - Use `{SNR}`, `{RSSI}`, `{HOPS}`, `{LONG_NAME}`, `{TIME}`, and more in response templates\n- **Tapback Reactions** - Optionally react with emoji based on hop count\n- **Always DM Option** - Force responses via direct message even for channel triggers\n- **Security** - Skip incomplete nodes that haven't sent full NODEINFO\n- **Built-in Pattern Tester** - Validate your regex patterns with live preview before deploying\n\n## Two-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n\nProtect your MeshMonitor account with **TOTP-based two-factor authentication**.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Security**\n2. Click **Enable MFA** and scan the QR code with your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)\n3. Enter the verification code to confirm setup\n4. Save your **backup codes** in a secure location\n\n### How It Works\n\n- After entering your password, you'll be prompted for a 6-digit code from your authenticator app\n- **10 backup codes** are generated during setup for emergency access\n- Each backup code can only be used once\n- Administrators can disable MFA for other users if needed\n\n[Read more about Auto-Acknowledge](https://meshmonitor.org/features/automation#auto-acknowledge)",

      "title": "Channel Database: Priority Ordering & Name Validation",
      "content": "MeshMonitor v3.4.4 enhances the **Channel Database** feature with priority-based ordering and name validation for server-side decryption.\n\n## Drag-and-Drop Priority Ordering\n\nChannel Database entries can now be reordered using **drag-and-drop**. This controls the decryption priority - when multiple channels could potentially decrypt a packet, only the **first matching channel** in sort order will be used.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n- If multiple channels share the same PSK, the order determines which channel name is associated with decrypted packets\n- Higher-priority channels (earlier in the list) are tried first during decryption\n- Reduces unnecessary decryption attempts by trying likely channels first\n\n## Enforce Name Validation\n\nA new **Enforce Name Validation** option ensures that a channel only decrypts packets that have a matching channel hash. This is useful when:\n\n- Multiple channels share the same PSK (e.g., default keys)\n- You want packets attributed to the correct channel name\n- You're monitoring networks where channel naming conventions matter\n\n**Note:** If the sending device doesn't include channel hash information in packets, enabling this option may prevent decryption even with a valid PSK.\n\n[Read more about Channel Database](https://meshmonitor.org/features/channel-database)",

      "content": "MeshMonitor v3.4.0 introduces **Geofence Triggers** - a powerful new automation feature that lets you trigger actions when nodes enter, exit, or remain inside geographic areas.\n\n## What Are Geofence Triggers?\n\nGeofence Triggers monitor node positions and automatically execute responses when location conditions are met. Define circular or polygon-shaped zones on an interactive map, and MeshMonitor will watch for nodes crossing those boundaries.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Flexible Zone Shapes**: Draw circles (specify center and radius) or polygons (custom boundaries) directly on the map\n- **Three Event Types**: Trigger on entry, exit, or periodically while a node remains inside\n- **Node Filtering**: Monitor all nodes or select specific ones\n- **Dynamic Responses**: Send text messages with tokens like `{LONG_NAME}`, `{GEOFENCE_NAME}`, `{DISTANCE_TO_CENTER}`, or execute custom scripts\n- **Routing Options**: Send alerts to a channel or as direct messages to the triggering node\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Arrival/departure notifications for family or team members\n- Asset tracking and delivery confirmation\n- Proximity alerts for restricted or hazardous areas\n- Ongoing presence monitoring in work zones\n\n[Read more about Geofence Triggers](https://meshmonitor.org/features/automation#geofence-triggers)",

Navigate to **Settings > Users** and select a user\n2. Scroll to the new **Virtual Channel Permissions** section\n3. For each virtual channel, verify the appropriate **View Map** and **Read** permissions are assigned\n4. Non-admin users will only see nodes and messages from virtual channels they have been granted access to\n\n## Other Improvements\n\n- **Emoji tapback reactions** - Replying to a message with just an emoji now renders as a tapback pill instead of a full message bubble\n- **Sticky/pinned nodes** in the Messages tab\n- **Map improvements** - Clicking a node with Show Traceroute enabled now zooms to the node if no traceroute data exists\n- **Link Quality chart** improvements for sparse data\n- **Channel fixes** - Correct encryption status display, preserved disabled channels, shorthand PSK support in Channel Database",

      "content": "MeshMonitor v3.1.0 introduced an updated **User Permissions** system to provide more granular control over channel access.\n\n## What's Changed\n\nChannel permissions now use a **tri-state system** with three separate controls:\n\n- **View Map** - Can see node positions on the map\n- **Read** - Can read messages from the channel\n- **Write** - Can send messages to the channel\n\nThis allows configurations like \"map-only\" access where users can see nodes but not read messages.\n\n## Action Required\n\nAdministrators should review their permission settings:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Users** and review each user's permissions\n2. Pay special attention to the **Anonymous** user - this controls what unauthenticated visitors can see\n3. For each channel, verify the appropriate **View Map** and **Read** permissions are assigned\n\n## Common Issue: Blank Maps\n\nIf users report seeing blank maps, this is likely a permissions issue. The **View Map** permission must be enabled for a channel for users to see nodes on the map.\n\nSee our [FAQ: Why is my map blank?](https://meshmonitor.org/faq#the-map-is-blank-for-anonymous-not-logged-in-users) for troubleshooting steps.\n\nFor complete documentation on the new permission system, see [Understanding Channel Permissions](https://meshmonitor.org/faq#understanding-channel-permissions).",
